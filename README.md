## Android Code Editor
“The Android code editor is an open-source project available on Github, developed with the love and contributions of developers. It supports both the Sora code editor and the Ace code editor, making it a versatile tool for writing and editing code on Android devices.”
It is the beginning of this app and I hope it will available soon for users.

#### Caution: file saving feature has not been implemented yet. So code editor does not save any changes you made to file.
